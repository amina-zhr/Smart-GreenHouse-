# User Interface
The user interface of our IoT Smart Greenhouse project, as shown in the image bellow, is designed to
provide users with a clear and precise overview of their smart greenhouse environment. By continuously
monitoring internal conditions and nutrient levels, users can make informed decisions to optimize plant
growth. The statuses of various devices, managed by the intelligent model, also ensure that all control
systems are functioning correctly, guaranteeing a stable and optimal environment.
